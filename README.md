# Sentiment-Analysis-from-Text-Reviews
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing problem where text is understood and the underlying intent is predicted. Sentiment analysis, also called opinion mining, is the field of study that analyzes peopleâ€™s opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations, individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. In this project, we analyse the movie review entered by a user for any specific movie and predicts what is the sentiment of the review.
